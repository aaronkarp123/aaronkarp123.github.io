var title = 'Restrained Form';

var description = 'This work is centered around restarint and its origins. A bass shaker underneath the wooden plank has three different frequencies running through it in isolation and combination. Each frequency accentuates the vibration of one of the three elements of the structure: the board, the sheet, and the rope. <br><br> The sporatic bursts of energy give the structure a lifelike quality, accentuating its struggle and ultimate inability to \'escape\'.';
