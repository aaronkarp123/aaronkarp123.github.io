var title = 'HaptEQ: A Collaborative Tool for Visually Impaired Audio Producers';

var description = 'Audio production includes processing audio tracks to adjust sound levels with tools like compressors and modifying the sound with reverberation and equalization. In this project, we focus on audio equalizers. We made a tactile interface that lets blind or visually impaired users create an equalization curve in an intuitive manner. This interface also promotes collaboration between blind and sighted users. Our primary goals were to make something easy to install and intuitively understandable for both sighted and blind users. The result of this research is the HaptEQ system.';
