Tonight I got drunk and spent an hour singing Karaoke with a 73-year-old Japanese taxi driver and his 48-year-old wife. I sat next to an old couple at a sushi bar tonight and they started talking to me. The man was a 73-year-old Japanese taxi driver and the woman was a 48-year-old factory worker from the Philippines. The taxi driver knew a handful of english words but his wife spoke a fair bit. They ordered me a bottle of sake, gave me some of their appetizers, then asked if I wanted to join them for karaoke afterwards. I figured I'd never get another chance quite like that.

They ordered me more drinks and they sang mostly old American songs, lots of Sinatra, in an old classic (verging on operatic) style. At the end of the night the man wanted my phone number and his wife wouldn't let him. She kept repeating "oh no, no, maybe we'll see you around sometime."

It was supposed to rain all day so I rode the bus to school instead of taking my bike. When I finished tutoring after school at 3pm, it would have taken me 1 hour to get home by bus and only 1+1/2 hours to get home by walking, so I decided to walk. It was sprinkling at that point but I had an umbrella and it was nothing too bad. The first half of the walk was along a little river. One bank had small houses interspersed with patches of trees, and the other bank was topped with ruined buildings, some looking burned, others just abandoned. Through the pane-less windows it looked like someone had taken a big straw and sucked all the inside out of the buildings, leaving the frame either because it was too tough or crunchy or どちらも.

The second half of my walk home from tutoring was on a long, thin street that was mostly populated by small repair shops operating underneath their owners' homes: vacuums, washing machines, carpentry, things of that nature. Plopped in the middle of a group of these, as if it had been carved out of Ginkakuji「銀閣寺」, carefully carried down the mountainside and across town, and meticulously inserted into a vacant lot between two repair shops, was a tiny temple. It was closed, but there was a magnificent garden out front. Its centerpiece was a water mill that stood 10 feet tall being fed by a small waterfall, churning into a small pond. The pond had some of the largest koi I'd ever seen. It was sprinkling and the rain made little punctures in the water. The koi would come to the surface to nibble at what might have been a bug. Two almost identical koi were circling each other during this routine, one with a red version of the other's black splotches. They circled for a few minutes then abruptly parted ways towards opposite directions, only to turn around after a few feet and swim head-on, passing directly over/under each other.

I fed monkeys at the top of a mountain in Arashiyama「嵐山」this afternoon. There was a very young and incredibly tiny baby sitting next to its mother. I had a bag of apple pieces to give to them. I gave one to the mother and she chomped it down, then I tried to give one to the baby but the mother grabbed it. I tried to lead the baby away a few inches and give it a piece again but after it took it its mother grabbed it out of its hand. I got two pieces of apple at the ready, gave one to the mother on the right side and one at the same time to the baby on the left, and as soon as the baby grabbed it the mother lunged for their hand but they scampered up and away, climbing the fence a few feet to munch down the apple.

In class a few days ago, RS invited us all over to his apartment and we all declined. Our field trip destination today was close to his apartment, so when he invited us over afterwards we felt obliged to say yes. He's a very friendly man, but none of us are particularly close with him. While the rest of us can speak in English when our Japanese fails us, he can only talk with us in Japanese, and given that we're all at a fairly low ability level in Japanese right now, possibilities for misunderstanding abound.

He lives in a four-story apartment building in Arashiyama, a bit touristy but absolutely gorgeous. As we walked up the stairs to his 4th-floor apartment, he informed us that he owned the whole building, and he had the whole place to himself. His actual room was fairly small, but incredibly Japanese-modern, with everything very neat and white and clearly quite fancy.

In Japanese he told us the plan: we would go to a nearby supermarket and buy whatever groceries we wanted, then we'd come back and he'd cook them all for us. We clarified many times this is what he meant, and so we went out shopping. People bought *way* too much food for a 7-person dinner, but it was fun to think about RS using the 30 different ingredients we got. When we returned to the house and unpacked the groceries, he told us to start cooking. It wasn't an outrageous idea for us to cook the dinner, but it had so clearly not been the plan that it caught us all way off guard.

But we made a huge meal and it looked gorgeous set out on his table. Before starting to eat, TS started a movie on RS's large television to the side of the table. He chose Superbad. So for the entire meal, we would occasionally talk, but mostly just listen to Superbad, which, if you don't remember, has some pretty wild mid-2000s high school dialogue.

My teacher said I looked like Spiderman. スパイダーマン。

I stared at the surface of Kamogawa「鴨川」for a long time tonight with a friend. The water was flowing vey quickly, but the river formed a static map, the hills and valleys of its shape never disappearing, only slightly shifting back and forth with the ebb and flow of the current. It looked so exactly like something, but I couldn't figure out what.

I ate in a restaurant with S today, who was visiting. There was music playing quite loudly the entire time, and it could only be described as a Pandora station for "The Office Theme (Radio Edit)".

When I haven't run in a week and I feel guilty about it, I run faster and further than I ever can normally. After a week stuck inside, studying and looping through the same thoughts over and over again, I broke all my distance and speed records tonight.

I graduated my Japanese class today! There's a lot I still don't know, but I've never felt so proud of myself for learning something new. I think I've worked really hard at this, and I'm happy to see my progress, even if the infinite road ahead looks a bit daunting.

Ran 6.5 miles with S today, which is further than I've ever run before. It was a pretty slow pace but it felt good to go far, so I might try and switch to that style of jogging.

During a big storm today, while waiting for a bus, an old woman and I both got splashed with water from a passing car, and we laughed together.
