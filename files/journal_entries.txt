Tonight I got drunk and spent an hour singing Karaoke with a 73-year-old Japanese taxi driver and his 48-year-old wife. I sat next to an old couple at a sushi bar tonight and they started talking to me. The man was a 73-year-old Japanese taxi driver and the woman was a 48-year-old factory worker from the Philippines. The taxi driver knew a handful of english words but his wife spoke a fair bit. They ordered me a bottle of sake, gave me some of their appetizers, then asked if I wanted to join them for karaoke afterwards. I figured I'd never get another chance quite like that.

They ordered me more drinks and they sang mostly old American songs, lots of Sinatra, in an old classic (verging on operatic) style. At the end of the night the man wanted my phone number and his wife wouldn't let him. She kept repeating "oh no, no, maybe we'll see you around sometime."

It was supposed to rain all day so I rode the bus to school instead of taking my bike. When I finished tutoring after school at 3pm, it would have taken me 1 hour to get home by bus and only 1+1/2 hours to get home by walking, so I decided to walk. It was sprinkling at that point but I had an umbrella and it was nothing too bad. The first half of the walk was along a little river. One bank had small houses interspersed with patches of trees, and the other bank was topped with ruined buildings, some looking burned, others just abandoned. Through the pane-less windows it looked like someone had taken a big straw and sucked all the inside out of the buildings, leaving the frame either because it was too tough or crunchy or どちらも.

The second half of my walk home from tutoring was on a long, thin street that was mostly populated by small repair shops operating underneath their owners' homes: vacuums, washing machines, carpentry, things of that nature. Plopped in the middle of a group of these, as if it had been carved out of Ginkakuji「銀閣寺」, carefully carried down the mountainside and across town, and meticulously inserted into a vacant lot between two repair shops, was a tiny temple. It was closed, but there was a magnificent garden out front. Its centerpiece was a water mill that stood 10 feet tall being fed by a small waterfall, churning into a small pond. The pond had some of the largest koi I'd ever seen. It was sprinkling and the rain made little punctures in the water. The koi would come to the surface to nibble at what might have been a bug. Two almost identical koi were circling each other during this routine, one with a red version of the other's black splotches. They circled for a few minutes then abruptly parted ways towards opposite directions, only to turn around after a few feet and swim head-on, passing directly over/under each other.

I fed monkeys at the top of a mountain in Arashiyama「嵐山」this afternoon. There was a very young and incredibly tiny baby sitting next to its mother. I had a bag of apple pieces to give to them. I gave one to the mother and she chomped it down, then I tried to give one to the baby but the mother grabbed it. I tried to lead the baby away a few inches and give it a piece again but after it took it its mother grabbed it out of its hand. I got two pieces of apple at the ready, gave one to the mother on the right side and one at the same time to the baby on the left, and as soon as the baby grabbed it the mother lunged for their hand but they scampered up and away, climbing the fence a few feet to munch down the apple.

In class a few days ago, RS invited us all over to his apartment and we all declined. Our field trip destination today was close to his apartment, so when he invited us over afterwards we felt obliged to say yes. He's a very friendly man, but none of us are particularly close with him. While the rest of us can speak in English when our Japanese fails us, he can only talk with us in Japanese, and given that we're all at a fairly low ability level in Japanese right now, possibilities for misunderstanding abound.

He lives in a four-story apartment building in Arashiyama, a bit touristy but absolutely gorgeous. As we walked up the stairs to his 4th-floor apartment, he informed us that he owned the whole building, and he had the whole place to himself. His actual room was fairly small, but incredibly Japanese-modern, with everything very neat and white and clearly quite fancy.

In Japanese he told us the plan: we would go to a nearby supermarket and buy whatever groceries we wanted, then we'd come back and he'd cook them all for us. We clarified many times this is what he meant, and so we went out shopping. People bought *way* too much food for a 7-person dinner, but it was fun to think about RS using the 30 different ingredients we got. When we returned to the house and unpacked the groceries, he told us to start cooking. It wasn't an outrageous idea for us to cook the dinner, but it had so clearly not been the plan that it caught us all way off guard.

But we made a huge meal and it looked gorgeous set out on his table. Before starting to eat, TS started a movie on RS's large television to the side of the table. He chose Superbad. So for the entire meal, we would occasionally talk, but mostly just listen to Superbad, which, if you don't remember, has some pretty wild mid-2000s high school dialogue.

My teacher said I looked like Spiderman. スパイダーマン。

I stared at the surface of Kamogawa「鴨川」for a long time tonight with a friend. The water was flowing vey quickly, but the river formed a static map, the hills and valleys of its shape never disappearing, only slightly shifting back and forth with the ebb and flow of the current. It looked so exactly like something, but I couldn't figure out what.

I ate in a restaurant with S today, who was visiting. There was music playing quite loudly the entire time, and it could only be described as a Pandora station for "The Office Theme (Radio Edit)".

When I haven't run in a week and I feel guilty about it, I run faster and further than I ever can normally. After a week stuck inside, studying and looping through the same thoughts over and over again, I broke all my distance and speed records tonight.

I graduated my Japanese class today! There's a lot I still don't know, but I've never felt so proud of myself for learning something new. I think I've worked really hard at this, and I'm happy to see my progress, even if the infinite road ahead looks a bit daunting.

--09/04/2019
Ran 6.5 miles with S today, which is further than I've ever run before. It was a pretty slow pace but it felt good to go far. My new goal is to find the end of the trail.

Went to a yaki-tori place for dinner,「焼き鳥一番」. It was delicious. I could read a bit of the menu, and spoke to the chef in Japanese. S said "he didn't look confused once." I ate a lot of exciting parts of a chicken, but the best thing by a mile was the yaki-onigiri,「焼きおにぎり」, a think triangle of rice kept on the grill for a long time, soaked in soy sauce over the open flame. Incredibly crispy on the outside, but the inside was soft with just a bit of soy sauce flavor the leaked through the outer crust.

During a big storm today, while waiting for a bus, an old woman and I both got splashed with water from a passing car, and we laughed together.

While walking back from dinner, S and I heard drumming in the distance. We couldn't make out exactly where it was coming from, only that it was somewhere across the street we were walking down. We crossed the road and went down a block and came upon a shrine「晴明神社」. There was a group of maybe 20 middle schoolers in a double-file line. One had a walking bass drum, two had snare drums, and the rest were holding traditional Japanese bamboo flutes. They were led by a man who was almost certainly a father of one of the children, who slowly walked in a big oval, waving a light baton- the kind airport workers have- in time to the beat. The kids stepped in time, making a slow loop, with a woman who was almost certainly one of their mothers holding the rear, carrying nothing but stepping in time behind them. As S and I watched, they made the loop again and again, playing the whole time, repeating music that changed rarely enough that it was difficult to tell how long the loop was, or if it was a loop at all and not a 20-minute piece they had all memorized.

S wanted to go out for a nice dinner tonight, so we went to a sushi restaurant he had researched. We walked in and the place was completely empty. The old man behind the counter emphatically said "Please, sit! Sit!" and we grabbed seats at the counter. He pulled out an English picture-menu of their sushi choices that must have been 4 feet long. He asked what we wanted to drink and I responded in Japanese. He asked if I spoke, I said a little, and then for the next hour and a half I had one of the most fun meals of my life. No one else came in at all, and the whole time he talked to me in rapidfire Japanese, barely giving me time to try and translate what little I understood to S. But I realized that actually, in 90% of conversations in Japan, I can get by if I look attentive, nod my head, say un「うん」and so 「そう」. I understood more than I expected and still very little, but I was actually able to converse a bit, and he didn't seem put off by me infrequent responses. At one point I apologized, saying that I could understand some but that speaking was very hard, and he said「ええ、そうそう大丈夫、上手です」. He talked about where the fish was coming from, what time of year was best for each fish, how to tell when it was good, what the weather was like, how tourists act from different countries. He gave us little samples of a few cuts of fish, some miso wasabi, and a shot of soju, and told lots of jokes. Everything was The Most, 「いちばんいちばんいちばん」, the biggest red snapper, the tastiest tuna, the strongest sake. The sushi was incredible, probably the best I've had. At the end of the night, as we were leaving, his wife brought out a printed copy of a New York Times article that had been published just one week ago that mentioned the two of them. The article was about the soroban/abacus and its presence as a teaching method in Japan. Their section of the article is copied here in full:

"Some older shopkeepers who learned to use the soroban as children still rely on them. At Daigen, a sushi restaurant in Kyoto, Yuriko Kawahara, 69, added up the cost of several meals on an old wooden abacus. "It keeps her from going senile," joked her husband and sushi chef, Tsumoru Kawahara, 69."

A two-sided picture board with a hole for your face to go in. The same thing on both sides. A bar door with a piece of paper taped to it that says "not suspicious" in English. A baby-themes gluten-free okonomiyaki restaurant.

Hanging out with A and J in Tokyo this weekend. First time we've talked about our Japanese abilities post-language school. They're both much further along than me. I think I may have learned some grammar concepts more deeply, but they can say so much more and do it so much more naturally. It's a bit deflating.

--09/07/2019
I wonder how I'll feel about big cities when I'm older. Being in Tokyo makes me wish that I loved it here. It has everything I could ever want and it's all a lot more convenient than Kyoto. It would also probably be easier to make friends here, expats or locals. But being in Tokyo (or New York or Seoul) always makes me feel a bit melancholy after a couple of days.

Maybe it's just hard to differentiate between feeling depressed and doing poorly. I think those moments are when I'm most vulnerable to thinking I'm lonely, whether or not it's true.

A, J, S and I went to karaoke tonight. About 45 minutes in, A queued up "Hollaback Girl", by Gwen Stefani. Through either a misclick or divine intervention, what played on the karaoke machine was "Harajuku Girls", by Gwen Stefani. I looked it up later to make sure it was actually be Gwen Stefani, and sure enough it is. I don't have much more to say beyond the suggestion of taking a look at the lyrics sheet and seeing for yourself.

First official day of work today! First thing in the morning I sat in on a two hour meeting about design materials for a project Y-sensei is working on. I understood one out of every 300 words spoken. The difference between Japanese people speaking to me and speaking to each other is staggering.

S-Chan is in the phase where it's funny for her to punch men in the crotch. This is unfortunate.

Met up with Y in Nara today, and the first thing we did is go to an Italian restaurant for lunch that I had heard about from a friend.

I was on the Karasuma subway line towards Kyoto station today and it was pretty crowded. I was standing up by the doors, and there were a few guys standing around me. One of them was staring intently at a poster on the side of the car behind me. After twenty seconds of doing this, he suddenly exclaimed "Karaoke!" 「カラオケ」, turned around, and walked down the car to the other end, where he stayed until we got to his stop.
